# PHP-contact
Simple PHP contact page

# Requirements:
 - Standard PHP 5 setup
 - Apache Web Server

# Setup Instructions:
These instructions are for a specific user of this software, you may require a different setup
 - Set variables at the top of release/contact.php to the correct values for your setup (between the comments)
 - Insert desired html and edit existing to your liking, without removing form fields or changing name attributes
 - Style form using existing ids or classes, don't add or change id if one is present
 - Ensure contact.php is readable by your web server/php engine
 - Also make sure that your web server properly executes .php files and doesnt just spit the raw file at users
 - Then place release/contact.php at the required location
 
# Issues:
